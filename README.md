# Dynamic Wallpapers for Gnome

This repository contains three different dynamic wallpapers for GNOME. It utilizes GNOME 3's XML format to automatically change wallpapers based on time of the day.

## Installation

To install and use wallpapers, simply go to the project root directory and run:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

This command will copy the files to /usr/share/backgrounds and the wallpapers will be available to choose from the background menu of GNOME settings.

## Removing wallpapers

To remove wallpapers, run the following command:

```
sudo rm -r /usr/share/backgrounds/Lakeside && sudo rm -r /usr/share/backgrounds/Firewatch/ && sudo rm -r /usr/share/backgrounds/Firewatch-tower/
```
